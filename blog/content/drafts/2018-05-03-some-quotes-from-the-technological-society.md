The enormous engine reaches critical temperature and explodes, dousing its operators in scalding steam.
They are thrown from its storeys-high walkways, or stagger away desperately trying to free themselves from clothes melting to their bodies.
["Moloch!"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moloch) cries Freder, the young protagonist of Fritz Lang's 1927 _Metropolis_, as he witnesses the horror of the accident.
He imagines the engine transformed into a huge demonic face, legions of workers marched to its maw to be sacrificed to the pounding wheels and pistons within.

The real horror, Jacques Ellul would have argued, was not the accident, but what Freder observed immediately before it.
Ranks of operators move in rhythmic tempo to pull levers and turn wheels in a precisely choreographed dance.
They are almost indistinguishable from the rotating arms of the engine itself, seeming to become part of the mechanism.
The engine functions flawlessly.

With this depiction of humans whose existence is dictated with such total precision by the needs and tempo of the machine, Fritz Lang anticipated Ellul's masterpiece _La Technique_.
In this work, Ellul explores how _technique_ (not merely technology!) develops in the modern world.

Technique, Ellul argued, is the rational maximisation of efficiency in all areas of human endeavour.
It resembles an ideology more than an artefact---though calling it an ideology would imply that humans consciously thought it up and promoted it.
As Ellul sees it, technique obeys only its own internal logic and process of development.
As it does so, it is transforming the whole of society in ways that seem inevitable and disastrous.

Because I found Ellul's work at times moving, at times beautifully written, always stimulating, and frequently excessively lengthy and difficult to get through, I decided to present a few choice quotes here.
I have accompanied them with some context, and tried to be as brief as I can be.
I think his ideas are valuable as relevant now as they were 60 years ago.
Any technologist who is serious about considering the social and ethical impact of their work should be familiar with the formidable force that is _la technique_.

(All quotes below are taken from John Wilkinson's 1964 translation, in the softback Vintage Books publication.
In defiance of Ellul's stance that "books are made to be read and not consulted," I have provided page numbers to avoid my own future frustration when working from such a sprawling source text.)

## On the nature of technique

&nbsp;

> Technique transforms everything it touches into a machine.
>
> &mdash; p.4

&nbsp;

Ellul describes at length the history of the human uses of technique, and its growth into what we see in the world around us.
He saw several distinct characteristics of technique:

**Automatism:** technique proceeds without the need for human decision-making, since technical results can be decided as a matter of mathematics, not judgment.

**Self-augmentation:** once a technique has been employed, it swiftly necessitates the use of further techniques, either to mitigate any negative effects it has, or to fully exploit its beneficial effects.

**Monism:** technique everywhere has a "single essence" despite the various ways it manifests concretely.
This allows Ellul to talk about technique in the abstract, instead of about specific technologies or methods in the concrete.

**Universalism:** as a result of technique's monism, technique acts to make all societies more uniform.

**Autonomy:** technique refuses to consider or allow non-technical factors to enter into its operation, and it thereby creates a "new society" with a "new morality", its own new universe.

> Just as hydroelectric installations take waterfalls and lead them into conduits, so the technical milieu absorbs the natural.
We are rapidly approaching the time when there will be no longer any natural environment at all.
When we succeed in producing artificial _aurorae boreales_, night will disappear and perpetual day will reign over the planet.

> The human being is no longer in any sense the agent of choice [...] He is a device for recording effects and results obtained by various techniques.
He does not make a choice of complex and, in some way, human motives.

&nbsp;

> To say of such a technical means that a bad use has been made of it is to say that no technical use has been made of it, that it has not been made to yield what it could have yielded and ought to have yielded.
>
> &mdash; p.97

&nbsp;

> The complete separation of the goal from the mechanism, the limitation of the problem to the means, and the refusal to interfere in any way with efficiency; all this [...] lies at the basis of technical autonomy.
>
> &mdash; p.133

&nbsp;

## On politics and the economy

&nbsp;

> For [the technician], the state is not the expression of popular will, or a creation of God, or the essence of humanity, or a modality of the class war.
It is an enterprise with certain services which ought to function properly.
It is an enterprise which ought to be profitable, yield a maximum of efficiency, and have the nation for its working capital.
>
> &mdash; p.264

&nbsp;

In the largest portion of the work, Ellul walks the reader through the consequences of the technical development of the economy and the state.
His perspective, from the midst of the Cold War, seems foreign to a generation born without the distant shadow of the USSR.
But his analysis of the technical basis for both communism and capitalism is illuminating, explaining the alienation experienced under both regimes.

Its effects on democracy he considered catastrophic.
The technique of propaganda, especially, threatens the freedom of humans to act according to their own judgement.
As methods for manipulating human decision making become more developed and effective, the popular will is directed in accordance with technique.

> We ought, on the whole, to abandon the idea of a ravaging and dictatorial state.
Let us think only of the cold and impersonal mechanism that holds all sources of energy in its hands.

&nbsp;

> Popular will can only express itself within the limits that technical necessities have fixed in advance.
>
> &mdash; p.209

&nbsp;

> The state rarely discovers and applies any true techniques, for the simple reason that it has too much power and too many financial resources for its agents to seek out economy of means---the first requirement. [...]
The private person, on the other hand, is constrained by pecuniary necessity to develop true techniques.
>
> &mdash; p.241

&nbsp;

> One of the gravest symptoms of our times is that technique has little by little emptied socialism of any content. [...]
The socialist state, because it is efficient, has been obliged to adopt the technical principles of capitalism.
Hence, in order to distinguish the socialist situation from the others, socialism always falls back on that vaguest of all concepts, teleology.

&nbsp;

> Every statesman is faced with the dilemma: either he must apply these techniques on their own invariable terms, or he must renounce them and forego the results they tend to produce. We must not lose sight of the fact that techniques furnish the best possible means, each in its own sphere.
>
> &mdash; p.268

&nbsp;

> All of us, more or less, take propaganda to be the defense of an idea or system.
We hear constantly that it cannot therefore be of any harm to the democracies.
After all, there are a plurality of political parties employing propaganda to maintain opposing or even contradictory ideas; the citizen has a free choice among them. [...]
The hope [thus expressed] comes to this: the citizen receives a blow in the face from his neighbor on the right, which, fortunately, is compensated for by another blow from his neighbor on the left.

&nbsp;

## On the adaptation of humans to a technical environment

&nbsp;

> The tool enables man to conquer.
But, man, dost thou not know there is no more victory which is thy victory?
The victory of our days belongs to the tool.
>
> &mdash; p.146

&nbsp;

One of the greatest feats of technique is its ability to integrate the existing natural resources, of which humans are a large and significant portion.
Far from a crushing Orwellian regime, technique acts subtly and realises that for maximum efficiency, the worker (for human workers are still necessary) must be appeased, and even happy.
No wonder Aldous Huxley was a fan of the work, and was instrumental in causing its translation into English.

Ellul describes at length the "human techniques" aimed at transforming humankind into something compatible with the new "technical milieu" being created.
The alienation created by the transformation of humans into machines is palliated by all sorts of compensatory techniques, from films and sport to education to ergonomics.

Ellul's bucolic ideal of the "natural milieu" before technique is difficult to accept uncritically, but his diagnosis of technical alienation, and his demonstration of further techniques which attempt to improve it, rings all too true in an age of mass media, dating apps, and epidemics of mental illness.

> To obey a multiplicity of motives and not reason alone seems to be an important keynote of man.
When, in the nineteenth century, society began to elaborate an exclusively rational technique which acknowledged only considerations of efficiency, it was felt that not only the traditions but the deepest instincts of humankind had been violated.

> It is important to consider, for labor, not only time but intensity. [...]
We know that the peasant interrupts his workday with innumerable pauses.
He chooses his own tempo and rhythm. He converses and cracks jokes with every passer-by. [...]
We cannot say with assurance that there has been progress from 1250 to 1950.
In so doing, we would be comparing things which are not comparable.

&nbsp;

> The further economic technique develops, the more it makes real the abstract conception of the economic man. [...]
The human being is changing slowly under the pressure of the economic milieu; he is in process of becoming the uncomplicated being the liberal economist constructed.

&nbsp;

> It is necessary to protect man by outfitting him with a kind of psychological shock absorber.
Only another technique is able to give efficient protection against the aggression of techniques.

&nbsp;

> Basically, the Soviets believe it necessary to discover not the individual's predestination but his adaptability.
Vocational guidance then has the task of adapting the individual, through education, to planned manpower requirements.
Vocational guidance is this subordinated to planning technique.

## On the future

&nbsp;

> Particularly disquieting is the gap between the enormous power [technicians] wield and their critical ability, which must be estimated as null. [...]
Yet it is apparently our fate to be facing a "golden age" in the power of sorcerers who are totally blind to the meaning of human adventure.
>
> &mdash; p.435

&nbsp;

Though Ellul insists he is no pessimist, it would take a very generous reader to come to the same conclusion.
His dialectic approach to his works might explain this; _La Technique_ presents the case for one side, which is compensated for in his other works of theology or social commentary.
In the closing pages of the book, Ellul indulges in a cathartic excoriation of the technicians who are not just (like all of us) structurally entombed in technique, but who enthusiastically prophesy the coming liberation of humankind through its means.
