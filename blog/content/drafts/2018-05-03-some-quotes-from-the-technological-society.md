All quotes below are taken from the _____ soft-cover edition.
In defiance of Ellul's stance that "books are made to be read and not consulted," I have provided page numbers to avoid my own future frustration when working from such a sprawling source text.

## On the state

blah

## On Ellul and the work itself

blah
