Things I would like to express

- Explain Royce's definition of loyalty, why it's different to how we typically understand it, and why it matters
- Put these ideas in the context of Royce's time period and question whether they hold up in the face of two world wars
- Tie loyalty into discussions of politics and changes that are happening in the world
- Tie loyalty into my personal life goals?

Loyalty is a bit of a dirty word.
It's been associated with so many unpleasant ideas, actions, and movements that it's hard for us to overcome its nauseating baggage.
When loyalty is mentioned, we are more likely to remember the Nuremberg trials than the civil rights movement.
We're more likely to imagine lackeys and lickspittles than we are heroes -- and even our images of loyal heroes are likely to be re-examined through lenses that reveal their privilege, supremacy and appropriation.

When I came across Josiah Royce's _Philosophy of Loyalty_, I had the same associations.
Well may it have been, I thought, to write about the virtues of loyalty in 1907.
We've had two world wars since then, and a good deal else.
But Royce's conception of loyalty seems to be like few others' before him, and few after.
His ideas keep echoing in my life.
In situations faced by people I know, in decisions I make in my own life, and in the raging political arguments that live inside our TV screens and smarphones, Josiah Royce's voice seems to be distantly audible.

Here I will try to focus and amplify those echoes, and show you how loyalty might be more relevant to your life than you'd have thought.
I'm coming to you humbly, I hope: aware of your probable and justified skepticism, but with the eager desire to overcome it.

Let's talk about what loyalty _could_ mean.
Ignore, for a moment, that redefining words is a fraught endeavor and usually futile.
Suspend, if you will, your inquisitiveness, because I will explain the _why_ of all this presently.
Let's talk about what loyalty _should_ mean.

According to Royce, loyalty was simply this:

> The willing and practical and thoroughgoing devotion by a person to a cause.
> A man is loyal when,
> - first, he has some _cause_ to which he is loyal;
> - when, secondly, he _willingly_ and _thoroughly_ devotes himself to this cause;
> - and when, thirdly, he expresses his devotion in some _sustained and practical way_.

(Apologies to women who are reading this.
Royce is not sensitive to his default use of masculine pronouns; nevertheless, he explicitly includes all people in the exposition of his ideas.)

Notice first tnat this definition talks about the _cause_ to which a person is loyal, and hasn't really defined what that is.
We'll come back to that.

Notice second that this framing of loyalty is quite strong.
To live up to it, you must act in _sustained and practical_ ways, not just pay lip service.
You can't be Christmas-and-Easter loyal, and there is no room for that comfortable state of being 'lapsed'.

But third, I'd like to draw your attention to the second stipulation: you must be _willingly_ devoted to this cause.
Royce deftly excludes from his definition the notion of 'just following orders'.
The implication is that if you did not follow orders, something worse would happen to you.
But you cannot be _coerced_ into loyalty; it must come from your volition and free will.
If 'loyalty' is imposed upon you, whether by threat of violence or threat of isolation, then it is no true loyalty at all.

If this sounds conspicuously individualistic to you, then I applaud your instincts.
Contrary to what we imagine about loyalty that erases individuals' wills and enforces blind devition, Royce begins with individualism as his foundation.

> Whether he takes account of the physical or of the natural world, every man inevitably finds himself as apparently occupying the centre of his own universe.

Humans are individuals; that much is evident to each of us, and Royce takes great care to preserve the sanctity of the self.
But, he argues, the self is not _enough_.
We are individuals, but we are social creatures and we thrive together.
For this reason, Royce argues, _loyalty_ is the only way to guarantee a happy life.

And that's the boring truth of the story: this letter is really about how to be _happy_, which is prosaic and trite, I know.
But I think there's a real difference to this idea of being happy in loyalty -- Royce-loyalty, not the blissfully oblivious loyalty of a cog in a machine -- and real value in exploring it.
So please read on, because to unpack why Royce thinks this is, we need to talk about _causes_.

Oh, and I'll get to the bits about Western Civilisation later, I promise.

_Superpersonal_ is a word that I think Royce made up.
It encapsulates the important parts of what Royce admits as a possible cause which one can be loyal to.
These are, in my poor paraphrasing:

- The cause must have value to you, personally.
  Thus, it is _personal_.
  Royce can conceive of no real loyalty to a cause that the devotee sees as worthless.
- The cause must have value _outside_ your own person.
  It must be "objective" as he puts it, and potentially have value to other people.
  Why? Because
- The cause must concern others; it must be _social_.
  The possibility of having "fellow-servants" before, beside and beyond you fulfils a deep need that individualism alone cannot.
