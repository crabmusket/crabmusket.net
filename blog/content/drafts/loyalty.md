Loyalty is a bit of a dirty word.
It's been associated with so many unpleasant ideas, actions, and movements that it's hard for us to overcome its nauseating baggage.
When loyalty is mentioned, we are more likely to remember the Nuremberg trials than the civil rights movement.
We're more likely to imagine lackeys and lickspittles than we are heroes -- and even our images of loyal heroes are likely to be re-examined through lenses that reveal their privilege, supremacy and appropriation.

When I came across Josiah Royce's _Philosophy of Loyalty_, I had the same associations.
Well may it have been, I thought, to write about the virtues of loyalty in 1907.
We've had two world wars since then, and a good deal else.
But Royce's conception of loyalty seems to be like few others' before him, and few after.
His ideas keep echoing in my life.
In situations faced by people I know, in decisions I make in my own life, and in the raging political arguments that live inside our TV screens and smarphones, Josiah Royce's voice seems to be distantly audible.

Here I will try to focus and amplify those echoes, and show you how loyalty might be more relevant to your life than you'd have thought.
I'm coming to you humbly, I hope: aware of your probable and justified skepticism, but with the eager desire to overcome it.

If I were writing for Buzzfeed, the title of this piece would have been '10 Ways Loyalty Can Save Your Life and Western Civilisation'; thankfully, I'm not.

## Loyalty

Let's talk about what loyalty _could_ mean.
Ignore, for a moment, that redefining words is a fraught endeavor and usually futile.
Suspend, if you will, your inquisitiveness, because I will explain the _why_ of all this presently.
Let's talk about what loyalty _should_ mean.

According to Royce, loyalty was simply this:

> The willing and practical and thoroughgoing devotion by a person to a cause.
> A man is loyal when,
> 
> * first, he has some _cause_ to which he is loyal;
> * when, secondly, he _willingly_ and _thoroughly_ devotes himself to this cause;
> * and when, thirdly, he expresses his devotion in some _sustained and practical way_.

(Apologies to women who are reading this.
Royce is not sensitive to his default use of masculine pronouns; nevertheless, he explicitly includes all people in the exposition of his ideas.)

Notice first tnat this definition talks about the _cause_ to which a person is loyal, and hasn't really defined what that is.
We'll come back to that.

Notice second that this framing of loyalty is quite strong.
To live up to it, you must act in _sustained and practical_ ways, not just pay lip service.
You can't be Christmas-and-Easter loyal, and there is no room for that comfortable state of being 'lapsed'.

But third, I'd like to draw your attention to the second stipulation: you must be _willingly_ devoted to this cause.
Royce deftly excludes from his definition the notion of 'just following orders'.
The implication is that if you did not follow orders, something worse would happen to you.
But you cannot be _coerced_ into loyalty; it must come from your volition and free will.
If 'loyalty' is imposed upon you, whether by threat of violence or threat of isolation, then it is no true loyalty at all.

If this sounds conspicuously individualistic to you, then I applaud your instincts.
Contrary to what we imagine about loyalty that erases individuals' wills and enforces blind devition, Royce begins with individualism as his foundation.

> Every man inevitably finds himself as apparently occupying the centre of his own universe.

Humans are individuals; that much is evident to each of us, and Royce takes great care to preserve the sanctity of the self.
But, he argues, the self is not _enough_.
We are individuals, but we are social creatures and we thrive together.
For this reason, Royce argues, _loyalty_ is the only way to guarantee a happy life.

And that's the boring truth of the story: this letter is really about how to be _happy_, which is prosaic and trite, I know.
But I think there's a real difference to this idea of being happy in loyalty -- Royce-loyalty, not the blissfully oblivious loyalty of a cog in a machine -- and real value in exploring it.
So please read on, because to unpack why Royce thinks this is, we need to talk about _causes_.

Oh, I'll get to the bits about Western Civilisation later. I promise.

## Causes

_Superpersonal_ is a word that I think Royce made up.
It encapsulates three important aspects of a _cause_ that Royce thinks it is possible for a person to be loyal to.
These are, in my poor paraphrasing:

- The cause must have value to you, personally.
  Thus, it is _personal_.
  Royce can conceive of no real loyalty to a cause that the devotee sees as worthless.
- The cause must have value _outside_ your own person.
  It must be "objective" as he puts it, therefore potentially having value to other people.
  Why? Because:
- The cause must concern others; it must be _social_, so that shared loyalty can bind us together with others.
  The possibility of having "fellow-servants" before, beside and beyond us fulfils a deep need that purely individualistic means of fulfulment cannot.

For example, under this system, 'my career' is _not_ an admissable cause.
It definitely has value to myself personally, but it doesn't really have value to anybody else.[^value]
It's not something that I can expect any other human to really be loyal to.
If they _were_ to be so, you'd probably call it a cult of personality.

But that specific example can lead us to an idea of what _is_ a worthy cause.
Say I am passionate about creating films that provoke, inspire and entertain.
My career might be a path towards that goal -- so 'my career' becomes an expression of my loyal devotion to the creation of art.
I am to act truly loyally only if the thing of _personal_ value is working towards something of _superpersonal_ value.

Similarly, 'my relationship with my spouse' would be an inadmissable cause according to Royce.
Even though this valuable thing includes twice as many people as my career, it is not _superpersonal_ yet.
Royce doesn't go into detail about exactly where we can draw the line between things that are _personal_, _interpersonal_ (which is what I would call the value of a relationship), and _superpersonal_.
I would hazard to guess he would look at it like this: can you walk up to a stranger and _plausibly_ expect they might be interested in your cause?
I can't really imagine any stranger would be invested in the present or future state of my relationship with my girlfriend.
But I could very well see them caring and thinking about, for example, faithfulness in exclusive relationships.
My conduct in my relationship can express my loyalty to that cause.

## Happiness

What do you think of Royce's conception of loyalty?
Can you identify things you're loyal to?
Things that inspire you to act, things that take up your time and things that invade your thoughts while you're in the shower or trying to sleep?

I can think of many things that people in my life are loyal to.
Veganism, AFL, the preservation of all sorts of history (from aviation to pop culture), queer rights, the treatment of diabetes, and the human rights of refugees are just some of them.
You pursue these things earnestly, actively, and in companionship or communication with others.

Some people aren't loyal to any causes in particular.
Maybe you're choosing to pursue things Royce would not count as causes; or maybe you'd love to, but haven't found any causes for one reason or another.
And of course, some of you are loyal to many things but still feel lost, because those things don't seem significant or satisfying enough: not enough to fill a life with.

## Nazis

Let's talk about Nazis.
They were bound to come up at some point.

Contrary to the views of some later thinkers, Royce would be perfectly willing to accept that there are loyal Nazis.
Nazism, as both a political party and an ideology, has all the qualities of a superpersonal cause that binds many individuals together.
Many Nazis, unfortunately, act with 'practical and thoroughgoing devotion'.
And I'm sure that while many were radicalised through peer pressure, social pressure or outright coercion, I cannot imagine that _all_ of them did.

Things I would like to express

- Explain Royce's definition of loyalty, why it's different to how we typically understand it, and why it matters
- Put these ideas in the context of Royce's time period and question whether they hold up in the face of two world wars
- Tie loyalty into discussions of politics and changes that are happening in the world
- Tie loyalty into my personal life goals?

[^ewin]: R. E. Ewin, quoted in the Stanfoed Encyclopedia of Philosophy. https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/loyalty/
[^value]: The the economic value, for example, of jobs I create if I am a successful business owner doesn't count. Anybody else's career could create that value.
