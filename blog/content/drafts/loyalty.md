Things I would like to express

- Explain Royce's definition of loyalty, why it's different to how we typically understand it, and why it matters
- Put these ideas in the context of Royce's time period and question whether they hold up in the face of two world wars
- Tie loyalty into discussions of politics and changes that are happening in the world
- Tie loyalty into my personal life goals?
